# HybridSinCosFit: Efficient fit of trigonometrical functions using a hybrid method

HybridSinCosFit is a Python library oriented to the teaching of physics that is able 
to fit in a very efficient way functions with the shape

`
f(x) = y_0 + y_1 * Sin(omega * x + phi)
`

whose are commonly use to describe harmonic oscillators.
